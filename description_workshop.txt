[list]
	[*] 1 Ranged Weapon
	[*] 1 Summoner Weapon
	[*] 1 Rogue/Thrower Weapon
	[*] 4 Healer Weapons
	[*] 11 Bard Weapons
	[*] 2 Accessory
[/list]

It is recommended to use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2619954303&searchtext=recipe] Recipe Browser[/url] to see how to obtain the new weapons.
